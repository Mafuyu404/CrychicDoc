## Overview

With this mod, you can:
- Build your own `single/multi-block` machines, giving them highly customized appearances and characteristics.

At the same time:

- This interface has rich shortcuts, allowing players to easily use complex functions.
- It provides detailed guidance, which can be obtained by moving the mouse over the question mark box.

@tab Highly Customizable Configuration

Each feature of `MBD2` has ==rich configuration options==.

Taking the multi-block area as an example:

- Players can control the `view range of the editor interface`, `blocks contained in the multi-block machine`, `position of the multi-block machine controller`, and `which side of the multi-block machine controller is used for interaction` by customizing these options.
- Players don't need to know any complex technical knowledge. If there are any doubts about the configuration, you can move the mouse over the question mark box to get hints.
- It covers most of the configurations needed for custom machines.

@tab Convenient Resource Import/Organization

`MBD2` allows players to ==control the resource files associated with each project==.

This manager:
- Separately stores the `resource files` associated with each machine, allowing players to efficiently `access` and `organize`.
- Supports multiple file formats, see the integration for details.
- Has built-in color formats for convenient related configurations.

- Any recipe-related `UI` can be customized.
- Recipe-related `resource files` can also be customized, giving them a high degree of freedom.

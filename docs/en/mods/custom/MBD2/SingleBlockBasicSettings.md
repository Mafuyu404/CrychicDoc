# Basic Settings {#BasicOptions}

This module can configure the [working state](#WorkingState) of the machine. Its `basic configuration` allows players to set the `block properties`, `item properties`, and `machine settings` of the machine.

## Block Properties {#BlockProperties}

:::outlined
This configures the [`block properties`](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_states) of the machine. There are detailed tips for each property in the game, which can be obtained by ==moving the mouse over the question mark box==. Therefore, they are only listed here with necessary expansions.

## Machine Settings {#MachineSettings}

:::outlined
This section configures the `Machine Settings`, allowing players to set the machine's attributes and recipes. Detailed tips can be obtained by ==moving the mouse over the question mark box==, so they are only listed here with necessary expansions.

This configuration does not require restarting the game.
